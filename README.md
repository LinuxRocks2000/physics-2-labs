This is my code for labs in physics 2! All of it is meant to be run in a python3.12 venv. To set up on Linux:
```bash
python3.12 -m venv phys2-labs
cd phys2-labs
source bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:LinuxRocks2000/physics-2-labs.git
cd physics-2-labs
```
and then just run the python files. If you want to pick a browser to open the GlowScript ones in (not all of them are glowscript!) invoke like
```bash
BROWSER=/path/to/browser/executable python lab.py
```
so on my system I use
```bash
BROWSER=chromium-browser python lab.py
```
